# Eduly-Task Frontend Challenge: Modern Best Practices Evaluation

This re-evaluation is stricter, focusing on your custom instructions and modern best practices for Next.js, TypeScript, MUI, and scalable frontend architecture. Each section scores out of 10, with specific feedback on strengths, missing elements, and concerns.

---

## 1. Folder Structure & Code Organization

**Strengths:**
- Uses `src/app/` for routing and `src/components/` for UI.
- Some modularity with layouts and dashboard components.

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- No clear mirroring between `src/app/` routes and `src/components/` folders for every route (e.g., dashboard components could be in `src/components/dashboard/`).
- No `services/` folder for business logic; most logic is in hooks or API routes.
- No separation for shared code (`shared-fe/` exists, but not fully leveraged for all common logic).
- CSS Modules (`page.module.css`) are present—MUI should handle all styling. Remove CSS files in favor of MUI’s sx/styled API.

**Score:** 6/10

---

## 2. TypeScript & Type Safety

**Strengths:**
- TypeScript is used throughout.
- Zod is used for API validation.

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- API response types are not enforced end-to-end (no shared DTOs/interfaces between frontend and backend).
- No evidence of strict TypeScript settings (`strict: true` in tsconfig, no any/as unknown).
- Some type definitions are loose; use enums and interfaces for things like exam status.

**Score:** 7/10

---

## 3. Separation of Concerns

**Strengths:**
- Most UI components are stateless and functional.

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- Business logic is mixed into hooks and API routes; should be in dedicated `services/`.
- No clear distinction between API clients (data fetching) and UI components.
- API mocks are directly in API routes instead of a mock service layer.

**Score:** 5/10

---

## 4. Internationalization

**Strengths:**
- Uses context providers and translation hooks (`useI18n`, `useTranslation`).

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- No `/locales/{lang}/{namespace}.json` files present—these are required.
- Some fallback/boilerplate text is not internationalized.
- Keys are used but need to be organized and externalized into JSON files.

**Score:** 6/10

---

## 5. Accessibility

**Strengths:**
- Uses MUI (inherently accessible components).
- Uses alt text and some ARIA attributes.

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- No explicit E2E accessibility tests.
- Could improve semantic HTML, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and focus management.
- Needs a pass with tools like axe or Lighthouse for accessibility issues.

**Score:** 7/10

---

## 6. Performance & Optimizations

**Strengths:**
- Uses `next/image` and `next/font`.

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- No dynamic imports or lazy loading for heavy/dashboard components.
- No evidence of code splitting beyond Next.js defaults.
- No caching, pagination, or optimization for API endpoints (only mock data).
- CSS files (page.module.css) are unnecessary with MUI.

**Score:** 6/10

---

## 7. Security

**Strengths:**
- No direct security issues in frontend code reviewed.

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- No authentication or RBAC logic shown (as per your org standards).
- No HttpOnly cookie/session logic (expected for real-world apps).
- No mention of sanitization or sensitive data handling.

**Score:** 5/10

---

## 8. Testing

**Strengths:**
- Zod validation provides some runtime safety.

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- No unit, integration, or E2E test files present.
- No test setup (`jest`, `react-testing-library`, or `cypress`).
- All new code should include at least basic tests.

**Score:** 3/10

---

## 9. Documentation & Comments

**Strengths:**
- Basic README is present (Next.js scaffold).

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- README lacks project-specific setup, architecture, scripts, or conventions.
- No JSDoc/TSdoc comments for shared/public code.
- No contribution guidelines or code style docs.

**Score:** 4/10

---

## 10. Component Library & UI Practices

**Strengths:**
- Uses MUI for layout and UI.

**Concerns / Missing Best Practices:**
- Should use a shared UI library (`ui-eduly`) for all MUI-based UI components; currently, components are local.
- Remove all CSS Modules and use only MUI’s styling system.

**Score:** 5/10

## General Recommendations

- **Remove CSS files:** Use MUI’s system for all styling.
- **Enforce strict typing:** Use shared DTOs/interfaces, enums, and `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`.
- **Mirror routes/components:** Every route in `src/app/` should have a matching folder in `src/components/`.
- **Extract business logic:** Move to `services/` and use hooks only for state/data fetching.
- **Internationalize all strings:** Store them in `/locales/{lang}/{namespace}.json`.
- **Add tests:** Cover components, hooks, and (mocked) API endpoints.
- **Improve documentation:** Add architecture, setup, and contribution guides.
- **Leverage shared libraries:** Use `shared-fe` for hooks/API, `ui-eduly` for UI, and `db-prisma` for Prisma models in full-stack projects.
- **Optimize performance:** Add code splitting, lazy loading, and remove unnecessary assets.

**Overall, the repo demonstrates basic Next.js and MUI competency but lacks several modern, scalable best practices expected from a strong frontend candidate. The missing elements—especially tests, i18n files, service separation, and CSS removal—should be considered essential improvements.**
